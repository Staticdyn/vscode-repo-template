## Introduction

Designers often find it cumbersome to work directly with code and Webflow's code editor might be sophisticated and lacks certain features. While tools like CodeSandbox offer some functionality, they miss out on the rich features provided by professional IDEs like VSCode. This project addresses these issues by enabling VSCode as the primary code editor for Webflow projects. It uses a simple setup and leverages GitHub for code changes and tweaks without the need to publish the site every time.
